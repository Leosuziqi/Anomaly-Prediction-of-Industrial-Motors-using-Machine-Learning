Predictive Maintenance of Induction Motors using Deep Learning Anomaly Detection using an Regression (Isolation Forest).

## Steps 1: EDA
Exploratory data analysis is broadly applied to observe and visualize main characteristics of data.

Below is an example of Anomaly from a real case in practical, the oscillation of frequency of motor drive can be found. The purpose of the first part of work is to detect/predict oscillcation with ML tools.
